The primary objective of the project is to build a Spam Classifier based on Semantic Similarity. The project involves a modified Latent Semantic Analysis for constructing a Latent Semantic Feature Space. As an alternative, we also construct a Corpus based Thesaurus for maintaining contextual similarity. Using these feature spaces as templates, the documents are vectorized and pass through a Feed Forward Neural Network for accurate and efficient classification into the binary classes of Spam or Ham.
